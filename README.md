# UtilityTracker
- Problem to solve:
  Each household has so many bills to keep track of and very few people know how much they are paying exactly in total each month for utility bills.
  Some people donâ€™t even know if they are paying too much for a month when they have a water/gas leakage.
- Problem solution:
  The utility tracker will let users input each of their utility bill. And calculate their total cost each month. 
  The app will display each bill summary in the dashboard.
  The stretch feature will include: 
    - give out warning when a certain bill is abnormally high based on user given household square footage.
    - Let users automatically fill in the new bills by scanning the provided PDF or image.
